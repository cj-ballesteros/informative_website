     <h2> Environment </h2>
     <p> The Polynesian islands were formed by molten lava that seeped through cracks in the Earth's crust. The Polynesian islands are located near the equator, making the climate humid, hot, and tropical. Most of the plants and animals on and near the islands originated from Southeast Asia. These species slowly moved to the islands through the natural distribution seeds and the movement of humans. Settlers also brought edible plants like taro, pepper, bananas, and coconut palms. </p>

     <h2>Religion/Practices:</h2>
     <p> Polynesian religions are mainly based on the experience's people have had with the people they worship rather than on faith. Their experiences can include "encounters" with gods and spirits, both good and bad. For example, neglected souls can be seen becoming wandering spirits, and aborted fetuses can be turned into vicious demons. Other experiences of this can be when someone is on the verge of death. The soul of the dying person can warn the person's family, without the knowledge of the person. After the person's death, the person may visit friends and family. </p>
