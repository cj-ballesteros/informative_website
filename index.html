                    <p>The Pacific Islands, also known as Oceania, is a group of islands located in the Pacific Ocean. The four major groups of islands in the Pacific Ocean are Polynesia, Micronesia, Melanesia, and Austrilasia. East of the philippines and north of the equator is Micronesia, with islands that include the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Northern Mariana Islands. Polynesia is located to the eastern pacific, formed by a triangular shape by the Hawaiian Islands to the north, New Zealean in the southwest, and in the east, Easter Island. Melanesia lies right under the Federated States of Micronesia, and northwest to New Zealand, which includes Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and others. Austrilasia is composed of Australia, along with New Zealand. Most of these islands are densely populated, with most of the population to be around the coasts. There are several distinct languages spokeen there, and most islanders can speak a little of english and french. </p>

                <h2>History</h2> <!-- Topic point -->
                    <p>Human's first started to migrate to the pacific islands more than 40,000 years ago. By the 2nd millennium CE, settlers reached every habitable island. When europeans arrived in the early 1500's, the culture of the pacific islands experienced changes because of the combination of various european customs merging with the island's own way of living. Yet, The problem with tracing back pacific islander history is that the documents that would tell us about the pacific island's past would be of european origin, and would most likely have a bias with their own culture and not describe other's accurately. However, one thing that historians definitely know about the pacific islands is how diverse it is. With the 10,000 islands clustered across ocean, cultures and languages would make the old explorers have difficulty generalizing the entire culture of the islands.<br><br>  </p>

                <h2>Environment</h2> <!-- Topic point -->
                    <p>In the pacific islands, There are two types of islands: high volcanic islands with a lot of plants, and low-lying coral atool islands that have not-so-great soil. The four states of the Pacific Islands has a very high elevated landmass at it's population centre, with seven islands rising to more than 500 feet, and some other islands having peaks of 2,064 feet.<br><br>The climate is very tropical, with humidity high and an average annual temperature in the low 80 Fahrenheit. There is, on average, 120 inches of rain per year in the area, yet Pohnpei, one of the islands, receives more than 200 inches a year. Sometimes there'll be distinctly rainy and dry seasons, with dry seasons occuring during December and April. Typhoons aren't the most unlikely, and they form in the east, spinning off towards Yap and the Mariana Islands, luckiliy avoiding the other islands in the pacifics.<br><br>High islands such as Kosrae and Pohnpei have mangrove swamps that grow along the shore, with grassland ascending to tropical rainforests in the inside mountain areas. Because Volcanic islands contain richer soil, it supports different species of plant and animal life. </p>
