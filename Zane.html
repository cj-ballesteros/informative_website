                <p>Melanesia is not a country, but instead it is a "culture area." Culture area is a term used by anthropologists and is to refer to a geographical region where families share many similar traits. These traits include many things such as family structure, marriage rules, organization of society, and ways of gaining survival needs or making a living.</p>

                <h2>Religion</h2> <!-- Topic point -->
                <p> Some religions in Melanesia are based on heroes and spirits, many of which are based around the creation of the world. War, prosperity, welfare, fecundity, and the cosmos need to be sustained through sacrifices and rites in order to keep peace, success, and well-being in the village. Spirits of the dead also play a big role in bringing success and peace to the village. These spirits, although dead, have to still be seen as being part of the community. If the spirits had their feelings hurt, they could bring trouble for the living members of the community. </p>

                <p>The sago palm is very important in parts of the lowland areas of Melanesia. The sago palm can be made into pancakes or dumplings. A sago pancake has the appearance of a freshly cooked, soft tortilla. In the higher elevations, yams are also a staple diet.
